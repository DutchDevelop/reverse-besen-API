Interest for Morec Wallbox For off loading and Photovoltaic production tracking.

Currently Morec Wallbox allows to set the max current, but only at starting charge.
For off loading in case of excess, this could be acceptable to stop the charge, but for Photovoltaic production, this is not possible.
This would be an over use of the Realy, and would wear it very fast. 

A typical load for a 5kw PV would imply chanding 16 times the max current of the WB.


Let's go back to Charging Protocol and how WB control max current.

"The OpenEVSE does not adjust the current itself but rather request that the EV adjusts its charging current by varying the duty cycle of the pilot signal, see theory of operation and Basics of SAE J1772."

So seems the Max current is always signaled in the line, it is really intended to be changed live.

Currently if we try to start a new charging session, with an updated max current, it is ignored. The idea would be to patch the
Morec Firmware to allow to set this max current, as done today at charging start only.
TO BE CHECKED how to manage limitation coming from the cable.
