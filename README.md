# The project

The BESEN wallbox is one of the cheapest on the market. But itâ€™s maybe the less supported one.
The wallbox is only manageable by an Android or iOS application. Witch is buggier than a first-year student project.
The goal of this project is to understand the protocol between the wallbox and the phone application to opensource the API.

# Status

#### Ok:
Understanding how the phone and the wallbox exchange data
Replay successfully of a past charging command, with an old timestamp without modify it
Stop charging command reversed

#### Progress:
Start charging command reserve on the go
CRC algorithm reversed and understood, but needs more checks
Reversing the only available firmware for ARM board (unknown model)

#### TODO:
Understanding the Bluetooth pairing process (UDP ports numbering)
What did the phone application sends to China ? (yes it does!)
Various broadcasted packet to finish to understand
Extract the current ESP32 firmware
